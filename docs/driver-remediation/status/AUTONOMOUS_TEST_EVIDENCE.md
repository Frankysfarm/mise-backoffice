# Autonomous test evidence

## TL-G0 environment isolation

- Requirement: abort before first mutation for any non-isolated environment.
- Scenario: `security-production-url-denied` and guard negative matrix.
- Seed: 42.
- Test run: `tl_20260801t160000z_a1b2c3d4` (first aggregate discovery run).
- Implementation: `tests/driver-system-lab/support/environment.ts` and provider sinks.
- Command/workdir: `npm run test:lab:guard` in `/Users/eule/mise-driver-remediation`.
- Exit: 0; 10/10 pass.
- Evidence: console TAP; aggregate report directory under `artifacts/driver-system-lab/`.
- Limitation: database mutation/cleanup integration is not yet executed.
- Reviewer: lead implementation; independent security sign-off pending.
- Gate: locally green implementation, review pending under TL-G9.

## TL-G4 independent oracle

- Requirement: independent enumeration, hard constraints, deterministic tie-break and property evidence.
- Scenario: oracle unit/metamorphic/property suite.
- Seed range: 1–500.
- Implementation/commit: `8a96ace5`.
- Command: `./node_modules/.bin/tsx --test tests/driver-system-lab/oracle/dispatch-oracle.test.ts`.
- Exit: 0; 11/11 pass including 500 seeds.
- Limitation: production-decision adapter and recorded optimality gaps are open.
- Reviewer: independent OR implementation agent; separate gate reviewer pending.
- Gate: local oracle green; system comparison partial.

## Build

- Command/workdir: `npm run build` in `/Users/eule/mise-driver-remediation`.
- Result: exit 0; Next 14.2.35 compiled successfully and generated 447 pages.
- Test-lab routes: `/test-lab` and `/api/test-lab/scenarios` compiled; both hard-hide in production by contract.
- Known limitation: repository Next configuration explicitly skips lint and type validation during build; focused strict test-lab TypeScript separately exited 0.

## Existing driver-system regression

- Command/workdir: `scripts/tests/run-t10-local-release-readiness.sh` in the repository root.
- Exit: 0.
- Result: all isolated PostgreSQL/source suites passed, including 100 overlapping atomic-writer races, driver API/RLS, pick/pickup, recovery/push/offline, GPS, deterministic dispatch, routing/hold, operations/security, migrations 285–288, route-before-depart, multi-order cancel/arrival, explicit append consent and UI/push contracts.
- Limitation: local disposable PostgreSQL/source evidence only; no hosted or physical-device inference.
